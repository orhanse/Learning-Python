# Week 2 – Data Structures and Iteration

This week introduces Python’s most important built-in data structures. You will learn how to store, update, and iterate over collections of data. These concepts are essential for real-world programming and prepare you for more advanced topics later.

---

## Topics Covered

### 1. Lists and Tuples
- Creating lists and tuples
- Accessing and updating items
- Slicing and indexing
- List methods: `append()`, `remove()`, `sort()`, etc.
- Tuple immutability

### 2. Dictionaries
- Key–value pairs
- Adding, updating, and removing entries
- Looping through keys and values

### 3. Sets
- Creating sets
- Removing duplicates
- Set operations: union, intersection, difference

### 4. List Comprehensions
- Compact syntax for building lists
- Filtering and transforming data
- Avoiding unnecessary loops

### 5. Iteration Patterns
- `for` loops
- `while` loops
- Looping through lists, dictionaries, and sets
- Using `enumerate()` and `range()`

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `exercise_01_lists_tuples.py` | Practice storing and manipulating data in lists and tuples |
| `exercise_02_dictionaries.py` | Work with dictionaries and iterate over key–value pairs |
| `exercise_03_sets.py` | Explore sets and operations for handling unique data |
| `exercise_04_list_comprehensions.py` | Learn compact list-building patterns |
| `mini_projects/word_counter.py` | A small project to apply Week 2 concepts |

## Mini-Project: Word Counter

Build a script that:
- Reads a text file
- Splits it into words
- Counts how many times each word appears
- Prints the results sorted by highest frequency

This project helps you combine:
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Loops
- Basic file handling

## How to Run the Exercises

From inside the `week_02_data_structures` folder:

```bash
python3 exercise_01_lists_tuples.py
python3 exercise_02_dictionaries.py
python3 exercise_03_sets.py
python3 exercise_04_list_comprehensions.py
```

If running from the root folder:

```bash
python3 week_02_data_structures/exercise_01_lists_tuples.py
```

To run the mini-project:
```bash
python3 mini_projects/word_counter.py
```

## Learning Goals for Week 2

- Know when to use lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets
- Understand how to iterate effectively
- Build list comprehensions to write cleaner code
- Combine data structures to solve small problems
- Complete a simple project that uses real-life patterns

**By the end of this week, you should be confident working with collections and writing programs that process structured data.**
