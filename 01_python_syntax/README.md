# Week 1 – Python Basics and Syntax

This week covers the core building blocks of Python. The goal is to get familiar with the language structure, basic operations, and how to write simple scripts. These fundamentals will support everything you learn later.

---

## Topics Covered

### 1. Variables
- How to create variables
- Naming rules and best practices
- Integer, float, string, and boolean values

### 2. Conditionals
- `if`, `elif`, `else`
- Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)

### 3. Loops
- `for` and `while` loops
- Looping through ranges, strings, lists
- Basic iteration patterns

### 4. Functions
- How to define a function using `def`
- Parameters and return values
- Scope and reusability

## How to Run the Exercises

From the `week_01_syntax` folder, run:

```bash
python3 exercise_01_variables.py
python3 exercise_02_conditions.py
python3 exercise_03_loopss.py
python3 exercise_04_functions.py
```


If you are inside the root folder python-learning, run:

```bash
python3 week_01_syntax/exercise_01_variables.py
```

## Learning Goals for Week 1
- Understand and use basic Python syntax
- Work with primitive data types
- Get comfortable reading user input
- Build simple logic using conditionals
- Write and call functions

**By the end of Week 1, you should feel confident writing small scripts on your own.**
