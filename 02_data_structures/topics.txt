Week 2 – Data Structure Exercises

1. Lists
Exercise:
Create a list of five numbers.
Print the first and last element
Add a new number
Remove one number
Sort the list
Print the final result
Learning points: indexing, append, remove, sort.

2. Tuples
Exercise:
Create a tuple representing a person: (name, age, city).
Print each element
Try modifying one element (expect an error)
Explain why tuples are useful
Learning points: immutability, unpacking.

3. Dictionaries
Exercise:
Create a dictionary with keys: "name", "age", "skills".
Add a new key "country"
Update "age"
Append a new skill
Loop over keys and print them
Loop over key-value pairs and print them
Learning points: CRUD operations, iteration, nested structures.

4. Sets
Exercise:
Given two sets:
A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
B = {3, 4, 5, 6}
Find intersection
Find union
Find difference
Check if a number is in the set
Learning points: uniqueness, set operations.

5. List Comprehensions
Exercise:
Given a list of numbers, create using list comprehensions:
A list of squares
A list of even numbers
A list of numbers larger than 10
Learning points: concise iteration, filtering, transformations.

6. Iteration Patterns
Exercise:
Given a list of words:
Loop with for
Loop with index using range(len())
Loop with enumerate()
Loop through nested lists (2D list)
Learning points: when to use each iteration pattern.


Mini-Projects
1. To-Do List (simple CLI)
Requirements:
Store tasks in a list
Menu: Add task, remove task, show tasks, exit
Loop until user chooses exit
Learning points: lists, loops, input handling.


2. Simple Phone Book
Requirements:
Use a dictionary where keys = names, values = phone numbers
Add new contact
Update existing contact
Search by name
Delete contact
Show all contacts
Learning points: dictionaries, loops, input, error handling.

3. Word Counter
Requirements:
Ask the user for a text input
Count how many times each word appears
Show the results sorted by most frequent
Bonus: ignore case and punctuation
Learning points: dictionaries, text processing, sorting patterns.
