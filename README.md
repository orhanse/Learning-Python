# Python Learning Journey

This repository tracks my progress as I learn Python from scratch.
It includes small exercises, notes, and examples that help me practice core concepts.



It also have some small project that I explore the capacity and capabilities of python

## Clinic Appointment System

A simple Python project demonstrating OOP with classes for Person, Doctor, Patient, and a Clinic manager.

## BookAI Reader

BookAI Reader is a desktop application written in Python that lets you build a personal library of ebooks (PDF, EPUB, MOBI, TXT, DOCX), read them, and use AI to generate summaries and embeddings for smarter reading workflows. The app ships with a simple Tkinter-based UI, a pluggable parsing layer for different formats, and an AI module built on top of modern NLP libraries.[web:6][web:14][web:17][web:24][web:25][web:31][web:34][web:35][web:40]
