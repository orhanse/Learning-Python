# Python Learning Journey

This repository tracks my progress as I learn Python from scratch.
It includes small exercises, notes, and examples that help me practice core concepts.

## Structure

- `01_python_syntax/`
    Basic syntax exercises covering variables, data types, input/output, conditions, loops, and simple functions.

More folders will be added as I move to more advanced topics such as data structures, OOP, error handling, and modules.

## How to Run Each Exercise

You need Python 3 installed.

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the folder that contains the exercise, for example:
    ```
    cd 01_python_syntax
    ```

3. Run any exercise file using:

    python3 <filename>.py

    Example:
       ```
        python3 exercise_01_variables.py
       ```

Adjust the filename depending on which exercise you want to run.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open any exercise file and read the comments to understand the learning goals.
3. Run the file, observe the output, and experiment by changing the code.
